# CE100 Essential Searching Skills for Librarians on Systematic Review Teams Syllabus

## Instructors

- Carrie Price, Health Professions Librarian, Albert S. Cook Library, Towson University, Towson, MD
- David Farris, Research Services Librarian, Research Medical Library, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX
- Rachael Lebo, Clinical Services Librarian, Wegner Health Sciences Library, University of South Dakota, Sioux Falls, SD

## Learning Objectives
* Interview researchers to define the key concepts of a research question
* Conduct preliminary searches to identify key articles and previous publications
* Select databases and other resources appropriate to a research question
* Describe and document planned searches and methods
* Build an extensive strategy for each resource appropriate to the research question
* Review search strategies under development

## Description

The course will take you through the systematic review searching process, from confirming the need for a review and identifying appropriate databases to creating search strategies and documenting and reporting searches using PRISMA-S. PubMed is the primary database used in the course. 

The heart of the course is developing an extensive, effective, systematic, translatable, and replicable search strategy to address a research question. You’ll receive feedback on searches during the live session and after the session via Slack. 

You’ll also learn how to conduct a reference interview to properly define a topic and how to translate a topic into effective search concepts. And you’ll be able to participate in the search peer review process that is now elemental to the searching community of practice.
